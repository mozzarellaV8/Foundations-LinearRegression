# Foundations of Data Science
# Unit 7.1 - Linear Regression Exercise

## Exercise: least squares regression
## ────────────────────────────────────────

##   Use the /states.rds/ data set. Fit a model predicting energy consumed
##   per capita (energy) from the percentage of residents living in
##   metropolitan areas (metro). Be sure to
##   1. Examine/plot the data before fitting the model
##   2. Print and interpret the model `summary'
##   3. `plot' the model to look for deviations from modeling assumptions

##   Select one or more additional predictors to add to your model and
##   repeat steps 1-3. Is this model significantly better than the model
##   with /metro/ as the only predictor?

# load data -------------------------------------------------------------------

states.data <- readRDS("data/states.rds")

# get labels
states.info <- data.frame(attributes(states.data)[c("names", "var.labels")])

#look at last few labels

# preliminary analysis --------------------------------------------------------
# for an energy ~ metro model

metro.energy <- subset(states.data, select = c("metro", "energy"))
summary(metro.energy)

cor(metro.energy) 
# It looks like the NA values throw off the correlation test.
# Even though I'd be throwing out data, I'd like to see some value.
# How many NA's are there? Significant amount?

is.na(metro.energy)
# Looks like there is only 1 NA row - the District of Columbia. 
# Because it's a special district and not a state, I feel OK omitting it - 
# if just to get an approximate sense of correlation 
# between Metropolitan Population and Energy Consumption.

# seeing a weak downhill linear relationship - cor value at -0.339.

# Outlier commentary --------------------------------------

# The outliers in this case appear to be states 2, 19, and 51 - 
# Alaska, Louisiana, and Wyoming. 

# When ranked by total population,
# Wyoming and Alaska are the top 2 least populated states, respectively.
# Louisiana falls toward the middle of this list. 

# The same goes for population density.

# What might be interesting is that Wyoming tops the list of greenhouse 
# gases released, Louisiana tops the list of toxics released. 
# These factors may be a result rather than cause of energy consumption, though.

# Alaska has the most % of adults with a HS diploma, most area + least density.

# All three of these outlier states rank in the top 8 least % of 
# House and Senate voting on environmental law. Could it be that
# legislation is a better predictor of energy consumption than 
# metropolitan population?

# Perhaps house and senate %, or density of population would 
# make a better predictor of energy consumption.

# Another explanatory variable might be `area` - the land area of 
# state in square miles.

# Revisiting my first intuitions - particularly on why Alaska

# the uniquely cold climate of Alaska and their role in energy production,
# namely crude oil, mining for natural resources and such. 

# Further investigation lead me to believe the reason certain states
# have higher energy consumption rates is because of the energy 
# production industry. 

# So! Let's take a look at energy as a function of waste, toxics, 
# greenhouse gas emission variables.

# So this model appears to be stronger than the original model using Metropolitan
# area percentage. But my intuition again says that cause and effect, while they 
# cannot be definitely inferred, are still too confused using these variables.
# I.E., greenhouse gas emissions could be a result of energy consumption.
